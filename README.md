# Cosmic Shooter Extended

This is a follow up to just getting a spaship flying.  If you want to start from this point go to the [Cosmic Shooter](https://github.com/maubanel/cosmic-shooter) github page and clone or download that version. This is the continuation of a very basic introduction to the Game Maker Programming Language (GML). This was done in Gamemaker Studio II. You will need to download this from [Yoyo Games](https://www.yoyogames.com/get).

This is an exercise where we introduce younger students to computational thinking, simple geometry and a little bit of physics.  This can be done with students as young as 12 (and maybe even younger).  It is inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids.  I normally do this by live coding in a theater where students come to the computer one at a time and I have the team help solve the problem as a classroom.

This will run both on the Mac & PC.  Clone or download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/maubanel/cosmic-shooter-extended`.

A video version of this can be streamed from [you tube](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=K9-naCAbo7o).

Run the game by double clicking on `CosmicShooterExtended.yyp`. Full walk-through is included in `instructions part 1.pdf` & `instructions part 2.pdf` (the first pdf is the cosmic-shooter repository and second is this one).

The music and sound effects were all generatively created.  The music was generated on [Wolfram Tones](http://tones.wolfram.com/).
